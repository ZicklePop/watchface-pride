# Contributing

So, you're interested in contributing, yay! There are tons of
pride flags and there is always room for more pride. Or,
there is a mistake somewhere. (sorry about that!)

Thank you so much for your interest!!!


## Adding/correcting a watch face

Create one in the Watch.app on your iPhone, preferably one
using the Stripes watch face. (exceptions can be made,
obviously Stripes is not ideal for the intersex flag.)

Once you have it created, hit the share icon and email it
to yourself. This will create the preview image and the
`.watchface` file. Rename both to the name of the flag.

Add those to the repo's root directory. Then you can update
the readme.

Here's a handy template:

```markdown
[temp â†“ ![temp][tempImg]][tempFile]

[tempFile]: https://github.com/ZicklePop/watchface-pride/blob/main/temp.watchface?raw=true
[tempImg]: https://github.com/ZicklePop/watchface-pride/blob/main/temp.png?raw=true
```

Replace every occurance of the word `temp` with
the flag name and add it alphabetically to the README.md file.
